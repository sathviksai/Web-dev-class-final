        <p>"Unlike kitties, while dogs do lick themselves, they don’t truly self-bathe. And, unlike a pristine indoor
          cat, your dog is much more likely to get dirty in the great outdoors (hello, mud puddle!). So you will need to
          bathe your dog with some frequency to keep them clean and healthy.
          How do you know when to bathe your dog? There are two times to bathe your dog: when he or she gets notably
          dirty, such as after a swim in muddy water, and your regularly scheduled baths. How often you bathe your dog
          depends on your dog’s breed. For example, hairless breeds need the most bathing, with hairless dogs needing a
          bath once a week to keep their skin healthy. Furred dogs and long-haired dogs don’t need to be bathed as
          often, as long as you are brushing your dog’s coat regularly. A good bath every 4-6 weeks should be enough to
          keep their coat shiny and healthy.

        <p>"Though pets are very adorable when pudgy; they, like humans, are actually in danger of many health problems if not helped out with a diet plan. To tell if your pet is a little too overweight for his health, compare your pet’s looks to the chart[to the left]! 
          Called “Body Condition Scores,” charts like this one are believed by many to be the best way to tell if your animal is in good condition weight-wise.

        <p>"Ask your vet how much exercise your pet should get routinely. The answer often depends on your pet’s age, breed, and general health. 
          Your vet can also help you decide what type of activities are best. While puppies and adult dogs may benefit from a walk or run, kittens and cats can usually get the exercise they need with toys that prompt fun and active play.
